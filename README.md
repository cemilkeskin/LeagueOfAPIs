# LeagueOfApi

## What this project does to the open source community

This is an open source API and with this project you can view what every champions role is in game:

1. Search your champion
2. Find the role
## Why is it useful

With this API you can view which role the champion has, so you can know what the meaning is behind the name!
## Getting started

This project was made using Node.js and Docker

Here the few steps before getting started:

1. Open terminal and navigate to the `api` folder using the command: `cd api`
1. Install all dependencies with the following command: `npm install`
1. After successfully installing all dependencies and packages, simply write `npm start` to start your server
1. Build container by opening a new terminal in your console and writing: `docker-compose build`
1. To get all the tables up and running simply write the command: `docker-compose up` to the new terminal we just opened.
1. Now that you have all your terminals running, you can test it out on your desired browser by writing: `localhost:3001/`

If the steps above are followed and done correctly, the tables champions & roles will be created and be ready to execute queries.
